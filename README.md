# GoogleCalendarImprovement
Google Calendar does not have a batch editing option for events that are not repeating. So I coded one up myself. You are asked to input a day or a time frame, and that deletes all the events within that time frame. 
You can also specify in the code if there are additional calendars you want to access, for example I have a separate calendar for "Classes". There is another file missing from this repository that is in my local one, which has my personal credentials that allow me to access personal google calendar data.
In the future, I will add the functionality of transferring all events to a different day, for example if my college follows a Monday schedule on a Wednesday.
